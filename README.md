## 🚀 Access DisasterIQ

DisasterIQ runs entirely in your browser — **no installation, no setup, no download.**

### ▶️ Live app: **[disasteriq.vercel.app](https://disasteriq.vercel.app/)**

**How to use it:**

1. Open the live app in any modern browser.
2. In the **Mission Control** panel, select a demo image pair — or upload your own before/after images.
3. Click **⌘ Analyze Damage**.
4. Explore the results: the AI **damage overlay**, ranked **priority zones**, the **damage summary**, and an AI-generated **situation brief**.
5. Click **Download field report (PDF)** to export a shareable report.

> ⏳ **First load may take ~30–60 seconds** while the free-tier backend wakes from sleep. After that, it's responsive.

<details>
<summary><strong>Run it locally (for developers)</strong></summary>

Requires Python 3.12 and Node.js. From the repo root:

```powershell
# Backend (FastAPI, http://localhost:8000)
.\scripts\start-backend.ps1

# Frontend (Next.js, http://localhost:3000) — in a second terminal
.\scripts\start-frontend.ps1
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000**. See [`DEPLOY.md`](DEPLOY.md) for cloud deployment.

## 🚨 The Problem

When disasters strike, response teams need fast answers:

- Where is the damage most severe?
- Which zones should rescue teams inspect first?
- How many structures appear damaged or destroyed?
- Where should limited relief resources be sent immediately?

Traditional damage assessment often depends on manual ground surveys, which can be slow, dangerous, and incomplete — especially after floods, earthquakes, wildfires, hurricanes, and other large-scale disasters.

**DisasterIQ is built to reduce that delay.**

## 🧠 What DisasterIQ Does

DisasterIQ is an AI-powered disaster triage dashboard that analyzes before-and-after imagery and converts it into clear emergency-response insights.

It can:

- 🛰️ Compare pre-disaster and post-disaster imagery
- 🏚️ Detect visible damage patterns
- 🎯 Classify damage severity across affected zones
- 🗺️ Display a visual damage overlay
- 📊 Generate damage summaries
- 📍 Rank priority response zones
- 🧾 Produce an AI-assisted situation brief
- 📄 Export a field-ready disaster damage report

---

## 🌐 Built for Global Disaster Response

DisasterIQ is not limited to one country or one disaster type.

It is designed for global disaster scenarios where before-and-after imagery is available, including:

- 🌊 Floods
- 🌎 Earthquakes
- 🔥 Wildfires
- 🌀 Hurricanes
- ⛰️ Landslides
- 🌪️ Severe storms

Example deployment scenarios include Pakistan floods, Venezuela earthquakes, Turkey/Syria earthquakes, wildfire damage assessments, hurricane-hit coastal regions, and other international disaster-response operations.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🛰️ Before / After Image Analysis

Upload or load paired imagery from before and after a disaster event.

### 🎨 Visual Damage Overlay

Damage results are displayed directly over the affected area, making it easier to understand the scale and location of destruction.

### 📊 Damage Summary

The dashboard summarizes affected structures and damage severity in a clear visual format.

### 📍 Priority Zone Ranking

DisasterIQ ranks zones based on severity, helping emergency teams decide where to respond first.

### 🧾 Situation Brief

The system generates a concise emergency-response brief that explains the damage pattern and recommended next steps.

### 📄 Field Report Export

Users can export a structured disaster damage report for response teams, coordinators, and stakeholders.

---

## 🎯 Damage Severity Levels

| Severity | Description |
|---|---|
| 🟢 No Damage | Area or structure appears largely unaffected |
| 🟡 Minor Damage | Light visible damage or limited disruption |
| 🟠 Major Damage | Significant visible damage requiring urgent inspection |
| 🔴 Destroyed | Severe destruction or likely structural collapse |

## 📦 Dataset & Fine-Tuning

DisasterIQ builds on the open **xView2 / xBD building-damage dataset** — paired
pre- and post-disaster satellite imagery with per-building damage labels.

### Getting the data

The full dataset is large (train and test archives are ~10 GB each), so it is
**not stored in this repository** (it is git-ignored). Download it directly from
the official source:

- 🔗 **Official dataset:** [xview2.org](https://xview2.org) — free registration required
- The download provides the pre/post image pairs plus labels and target masks

This repo already ships **one demo pair** (`backend/uploads/`) so the app runs
end-to-end out of the box, no download needed.

### Curate demo pairs from the full dataset

After downloading and extracting the test archive to `data/test/`:

```powershell
.\scripts\curate_demo_subset.ps1
```

This copies the pairs listed in `data/demo/manifest.json` into `data/demo/`.

### Fine-tuning

To fine-tune the damage model on AMD GPUs (ROCm), see
[`ml/finetune/README.md`](ml/finetune/README.md) for the full pipeline —
extract the train archive, filter to the target hazard types with
`scripts/prepare_train_subset.py`, then run the xView2 training workflow.
